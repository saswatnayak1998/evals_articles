In classical computing, bits are confined to definite states of either 0 or 1. However, quantum superposition allows quantum bits, or qubits, to exist in multiple states simultaneously. This means a qubit can be both 0 and 1 at the same time, along with any combination in between, until it is measured.",

The categorical imperative introduces the concept of 'universalizability,' which posits that an action is morally right only if the maxim behind it could be willed as a universal law applicable to all rational beings.",
